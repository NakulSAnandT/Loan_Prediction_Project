# Loan Approval Prediction
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on applicant information, financial factors, and credit history using machine learning techniques. The project is currently in progress, and the deployment phase through Streamlit is underway.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to automate the loan approval process and assist loan providers in making informed decisions. By analyzing various features such as gender, marital status, education, income, and credit history, the model predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not.
